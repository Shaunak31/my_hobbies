              This shot is usually played to deliveries of a good to full length that are on the middle stump or off
              stump line.
              This shot is a front foot shot, which means your front foot should be going down the pitch towards the
              area where the ball is bouncing.
              Your front leg should be bent slightly, and your head should be above your front knee. When you strike the
              ball, the bat face should be facing directly back towards the bowler.

              It’ll definitely help you develop some new attacking and defensive strategies!

              The on drive is usually played to deliveries of a good to full length that are on a leg stump line or just
              sliding on to the pads.During the on drive, the front foot will ideally move straight forwards towards the
              pitch and line of the ball. The front knee should be slightly bent and the weight of your head should be
              over your front knee. As the bat comes through to strike the ball, the face should be angled towards the
              leg side of the bowler.

            <p class="card-text">
              The forward defence is a shot that all players must be able to play, because although we would like to
             attack all the time, sometimes it just isn’t advisable! It’s a shot that you’ll see played against all
              types of bowlers, and it isn’t really hit in a specific area. The goal is to just nullify the ball and
              hit it into the ground somewhere close to the wicket.The technique used to play the forward defence is
              very similar to the technique used to play the drive shots. Except this time, there is no follow through!
              Your front foot should move towards the pitch and line of the ball and again, the front knee should be
              slightly bent, with the head over that front knee. The bat should come down next to the knee leaving
              minimal room in between bat and pad for a moving ball to sneak through. When you make contact with the
              ball, it is often best to angle the bat ever so slightly towards the ground, especially if there are
              fielders close by waiting to take a sharp catch!

            <p class="card-text">
              The sweep shot is often pre-meditated. This means that the batsman will often decide to play the shot before
               the bowler runs in to bowl. It is most effective when it is played to balls on a good to full length. As 
               for the line, you will most often see it played to deliveries that are pitching anywhere leg-side of the 
               off-stump. You will also see it played to deliveries that are spinning towards the batsman’s body as these
               are easier to hit into the leg-side. During the sweep shot you should take a large stride down the pitch 
               with your front foot. The stride should be a comfortable length, not large enough that it ruins your 
               balance! The large stride helps you to smother the spin generated by the bowler, and may even mean that you
               can hit the ball on the full without having to judge the bounce.
